The average temperatures range from 30C in summer to -30C in winter.</p>\r\n      <p>I have been interested in programming since 2015, when I studied at the Lahti University Of Applied Sciences. During my studies, I was introduced to C# and PHP. I did my internship working with Wordpress websites and fell in love with web development. I started pursuing a career in web development in 2019. <a href=\"https://fullstackopen.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Full Stack Open 2019</a> was the true starting point for my career and it has been a great catalyst and introduction to fullstack development. I have since worked at two companies. My first job was with maintaining Wordpress websites. I've since moved on to become a software consultant. I especially like working with the front end side of web development, as I like making visually interesting, functional and appealing websites. I am constantly learning more about back end development and working on expanding my programming language catalogue as a whole.</p>\r\n    </Layout>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default About;\r\n\r\nexport const pageQuery = graphql`\r\n  query {\r\n    site {\r\n      siteMetadata {\r\n        title\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n`;\r\n"],"names":["_ref","data","location","siteTitle","site","siteMetadata","title","React","Layout","SEO","href","target","rel"],"sourceRoot":""}
